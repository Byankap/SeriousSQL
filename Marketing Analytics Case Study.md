### ERD Diagrams using dbdiagram.io

Example on how to create them
```
Table "rental" {
  "rental_id" integer [not null]
  "rental_date" timestamp [not null]
  "inventory_id" integer [not null]
  "customer_id" smallint [not null]
  "return_date" timestamp
  "staff_id" smallint [not null]
  "last_update" timestamp [not null, default: `now()`]

Indexes {
  inventory_id [type: btree, name: "idx_fk_inventory_id"]
  (rental_date, inventory_id, customer_id) [type: btree, unique, name: "idx_unq_rental_rental_date_inventory_id_customer_id"]
}
}

Table "inventory" {
  "inventory_id" integer [not null, default: `nextval('inventory_inventory_id_seq'::regclass)`]
  "film_id" smallint [not null]
  "store_id" smallint [not null]
  "last_update" timestamp [not null, default: `now()`]

Indexes {
  (store_id, film_id) [type: btree, name: "idx_store_id_film_id"]
}
}
```
#### Embedding interactive ERD

In a markdown document, the following code can be used to generate ERD using iframe
```
<iframe height="400" width="100%"
